# Run in Gitea

Gitea announced [feature preview GitHub Actions](https://blog.gitea.io/2022/12/feature-preview-gitea-actions/)

I'd like to test it and confirm it works...

## Alternatives

You should be able to use [Run from command line](./Feature:-Run-from-command-line.md) -- just ensure that check-spelling is available and the repository to check are available.
