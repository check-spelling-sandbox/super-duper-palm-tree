# `.git-blame-ignore-revs`

One concern people have about taking spelling fixes
(or whitespace cleanup for that matter)
is that blame is shifted
(potentially for large swaths of the codebase)
to a drive-by contributor.

It's actually possible to partially address this with the
introduction of a file.

Consensus for the filename appears to be `.git-blame-ignore-revs`:

This isn't something that a cleanup PR itself should
include, because it's reliant on the final commit-refs
which aren't known until the PR is merged (especially
if a project rebases, but also it'd be painful to
maintain while responding to reviews).

But it shouldn't be particularly hard to write a bot
which given a bunch of GitHub (or GitLab) PRs (or commits)
generated a PR (or just a commit) to update the file.

- [Request for GitHub to warn about rebase/squash merging such entries](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/136477)

It seems like a pretty neat small project, which someone
could/should do.
